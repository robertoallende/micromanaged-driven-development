# Unit 06: Small Changes

## Objective

Implement small organizational improvements to the MMDD project:
1. Rename `00_mdd.md` to `00_mmdd.md` for better consistency with project naming
2. Update documentation references from `00_main.md` to `01_main.md` (conceptual change, file stays as `00_main.md`)
3. Update MMDD principles to version 2
4. Remove planned but unimplemented Units 3 and 4 from project plan

## Implementation

**File Renaming:**
- Rename `dev_log/00_mdd.md` to `dev_log/00_mmdd.md`
- Update all references in README.md to point to new filename

**Reference Updates:**
- Update references in `00_mdd.md` (now `00_mmdd.md`) from `00_main.md` to `01_main.md`
- Update references in README.md from `00_main.md` to `01_main.md`
- Keep actual file as `00_main.md` in dev_log directory

**Version Update:**
- Change version from "version 1" to "version 2" in MMDD principles

**Project Plan Cleanup:**
- Remove Units 3 and 4 from planned units in `00_main.md`
- Update project status to reflect current state
