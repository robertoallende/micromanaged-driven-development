# Unit 05: Abbreviation Change - MDD to MMDD

## Objective

Update all occurrences of the abbreviation from "MDD" to "MMDD" and "mdd" to "mmdd" throughout the project to better distinguish Micromanaged Driven Development from other methodologies that use the MDD abbreviation.

## Implementation

Systematic search and replace of all abbreviation instances across the entire project:

- Search for all case variations: MDD, mdd, Mdd
- Update documentation files, templates, and any other references
- Maintain consistency across all project files
- Preserve full name "Micromanaged Driven Development" while updating abbreviation
